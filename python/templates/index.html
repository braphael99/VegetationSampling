        <h3>About the Dataset:</h3><br>
        <p>This dataset was pulled from Kaggle, posted by user Miguel Rojas. This dataset is being used under the 
            <a href = "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</a> licensing rights.
            Here is what the poster had to say about this dataset: "This data contains information about a vegetation sampling made in 
            'Cerro El Volcán' located in Caracas, Venezuela, covered by a dense forest classified as 'Premontane Moist Forest' by Holdridge.
            The sampling was carried out as part of the 'Ecology Laboratory I' course from the biology carrer at Central University of Venezuela in the period I-2023, 
            in an area of 400 m².
            Data presented here corresponds to synthetic generated data based on real observations, so it preserves the original characteristics of the dataset."
            This dataset originally had 8 variables, but we will be manipulating 6, with height as our target variable. Here is a link to the
            original Kaggle dataset: <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itsmiguelrojas/humid-forest-sampling/">Original Vegetation Sampling Dataset</a>.
